Description: Simulation and analysis framework for assessing fishery management
    implications of demographic change in Pacific salmon. Implements an empirically 
    based simulation (management strategy
    evaluation, MSE) that propagates shifts in age, sex, and length
    compositions through stock-recruit dynamics and harvest control rules.
    Provides tools to select and run scenario grids, record outputs in a simple
    'ssi_run' object, summarize trajectories (e.g., last-50-year means and
    by-year quantiles), and reproduce the figures used in the associated study.
    Management procedures include a time-invariant Ricker model (TRM),
    yield-per-recruit (YPR), and a dynamic linear model (DLM) with time-varying
    parameters. Performance metrics include long-term mean harvest, return, and
    escapement; conservation risk indicators (e.g., probabilities that
    recruitment > 0.5*Rmax and escapement > 0.5*S0); and the probability of
    zero harvest. Plotting functions generate publication-quality figures (A-C,
    2-7) with consistent labeling and color schemes. This package accompanies
    Ohlberger, Schindler, and Staton (2025), "Accounting for salmon body size
    declines in fishery management can reduce conservation risks" (Fish and
    Fisheries, 26:113â€“130; <doi:10.1111/faf.12869>), and supports reproducible
    research.
